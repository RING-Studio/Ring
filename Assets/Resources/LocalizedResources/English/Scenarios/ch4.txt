Ergong::“Huh? Why does it take so long to get a cup?”

The president asks in suspicious.

Zhunei::“Sorry, it's too dark there.”

I push my sunglasses. The president reluctantly accepts the excuse.

I put the cup on the table and slowly pour out the milk tea.

I intentionally pour so slowly.

But eventually the cup will be full.

Gaotian looks happy, and I smile back at her stiffly.

At this moment, my remaining eyes see Qianye's face changed.

What had happened?

Xiben::“I want a drink too.”

Unexpectedly, Xiben gets next to me and draws a cup from my arms.

The ribbon in her hair grazes my nose as she bends down.

Gaotian::“…umm, Xiben…”

Gaotian has an overwhelmed expression, looking like a wounded deer.

Xiben's hands falter, but she pretends not to see it and continues pouring the milk tea into the cup.

Xiben had been keeping away from others in the high school. Her strange behavior alerts the president.

I'm sure the president didn't miss my stiff expression. She's looking back and forth at Xiben, Gaotian, and me.

Qianye tried to say something, but the president gets ahead of him.

Ergong::“It's okay. There's still enough milk tea.”

Ergong::“Maybe Xiben is a little thirsty too.”

Qianye::“B-But…Zhunei and Gaotian are…”

Ergong::“We are all friends. What does it matter?”

The president says as she casually messes up the cups on the table.

All three disposable cups are filled with milky white liquid. No one is able to distinguish them anymore.

Qianye sneaks a glance at the empty glass vial in the trash bin, then shows a desperate expression.

Ergong::“Zhunei, let's drink first. Everybody has a drink, and Gaotian and Xiben don't mind, right?”

They do mind.

Gaotian is not only refusing. Her tears are about to well up.

But being too anxious, she can't make her words out.

Xiben stays still, as if she has lost her soul.

The president smiles and looks at me. She must have guessed out something.

Qianye looks at me as well.

Time seems to freeze at this moment.

The raindrops outside also seem to stop in the air.

With a trembling hand, I take off my sunglasses—

Suddenly, the world turned gray.

It's a rare disease that can take the joy out of life.

A world without color is desperate.

Twice as many people who suffer from this disease commit suicide than die of it.

But in contrast, some otherwise colorless substances now show wonderful colors.

Normal people can't understand those colors, just like blind people can't understand darkness.

I drain all the milk tea in that cup—I've already seen that color in the toilet.

Then I put the cup down.

Nothing around me, no sound in my ears, can bind me any longer.

I am free, but too weak to move.

I turn my eyes out of the window with all my strength.

The scenery is gray and blurred, as if an old photograph.

I stare at the everlasting raindrops.

In my eyes, the colorless raindrops are shining like rainbows.

Because you didn't get the flag of Xiben, we cannot make up the plot…

BAD END
