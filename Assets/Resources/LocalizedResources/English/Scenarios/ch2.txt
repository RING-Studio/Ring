Zhunei::“What's it this time?”

I stand in front of the mirror, watching the sunglasses dangling depressively from my face.

The faucet in the sink is running, and the sound of the flowery water is almost drowning out my voice.

That man takes off my sunglasses.

It makes me dizzy because of the light.

? ? ?::“The time has come.”

Zhunei::“……”

? ? ?::"Don't you understand? It's a wonderful chance that I had a hard time to create!”

His face turns grim.

? ? ?::“Mr. Beitiao can't wait. We didn't send you here to make you fall in love.”

Zhunei::“I still don't understand, why a father would want to kill his own daughter.”

? ? ?::“Because it's his illegitimate daughter. The election is coming up, and one of the candidates already started to get him in trouble from that.”

The man shrugs his shoulders as if bored.

That's his particular habit.

? ? ?::“Huh, forget it. You idiot will never understand all this political stuff.”

After losing my sunglasses, my eyes had a hard time adjusting to the light.

I see a glass vial sitting quietly by the sink.

? ? ?::“Add it to her milk tea. Be sharp with your hands. This colorless, tasteless poison may be more expensive than you.”

I don't say anything, nor do I go for the vial. I just gaze at it.

As if gazing at something wondrous.

The man turns his face and taps my cheek with my sunglasses frame.

The dry popping sound of the toilet mingles with the sound of rushing water.

? ? ?::“Don't forget how much Mr. Beitiao spent to treat your eyes.”

? ? ?::“And in whose hospital your mother is lying now.”

I pick up the vial, and snatch the sunglasses back from his hands.

Zhunei ::“Sorry, I didn't see it clearly.”

Zhunei::“You know, my eyes aren't good.”

? ? ?::“Huh, idiot.”

As I leave the toilet, the man is still cursing at my back.

? ? ?::“Don't screw it up! Watch out for the president, she may be from the other side…”

In the end, all sounds are masked under the rushing water.

Next, I'm going to…
